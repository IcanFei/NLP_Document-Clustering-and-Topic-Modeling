•	Used natural language processing to analyze the customer’s views from a watch e-commerce

•	Clustered unlabeled textual documents into groups and discovered latent semantic structures

•	Preprocessed text by tokenizing, stemming and stop-words removing, and extracted features by term frequency-inverse document frequency approach

•	Trained unsupervised learning models of K-means Clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation and identified latent topics and keywords of each document for clustering and similarity calculation.
